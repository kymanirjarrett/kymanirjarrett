# Kymani Jarrett

**'Software | Web App Developer'**

I am a sophomore IT major at the University of Cincinnati, with a strong passion for technological applications and innovative solutions to real-world problems. 
Through my coursework, hands-on projects, and internships, I have developed a solid foundation in modern frameworks and IT infrastructures. 
I have experience in web application development using React, among other relevant coding languages, as well as experience in C# and Python. <br>

Currently, I am seeking a co-op for the Fall 2025 semester, where I can apply my skills and knowledge in a professional setting. 
I look forward to networking with new people and making meaningful connections within the industry!
